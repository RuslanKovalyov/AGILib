Include a comment like this at the top of source code files. It briefly states the copyright, the license, where to find the full license text, and the warranty disclaimer.

Please keep in mind that this isn't legally required for the Apache License 2.0, but it's often considered a good practice. For some other licenses, including a license header in each file might be required or recommended.

Also, be aware that if a file is under a different license, it should have a different header that reflects the correct license.
